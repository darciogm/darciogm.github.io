# AN-011: Horse race — continuous vs binary FL

!!! abstract "Intuition (plain-language)"
    The screen has a binary version (a firm is flagged if its bid count exceeds the cutoff) and a continuous version (log of bid count). The continuous version statistically dominates. The paper's interpretation: the continuous score is the empirical primitive; the binary cutoff is the simpler, deployable rule a regulator would actually use in the field.

## Question

Does the continuous `log(1 + tenders_count)` dominate the binary `FL14`
on the cobidder target? The binary rule is auditable but the continuous
score carries the full information.

## Design

- **Sample**: harmonized same-sample set in BEC 2009–2019; N = 1,653,658
  item-firm observations.
- **Specifications**: AUC of `FL14` (binary) vs
  `log(1 + tenders_count)` (continuous).
- **Statistical test**: DeLong AUC-difference test on paired
  predictions.
- **Auxiliary**: price coefficients in three configurations (FL14
  alone, continuous alone, joint).

## Results

| Score | AUC | 95% CI |
|---|---:|---|
| FL14 (binary) | 0.911 | [0.898, 0.925] |
| Continuous log(1+tenders_count) | **0.939** | [0.932, 0.946] |

DeLong test: Z = −4.30, p = 2 × 10⁻⁵.

Auxiliary price coefficients (item × year × PBU FE):

| Specification | FL coef | SE | Continuous coef | SE |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| FL14 binary alone | +0.0653*** | 0.0216 | — | — |
| Continuous alone | — | — | +0.0188*** | 0.0055 |
| Joint | −0.0746* | 0.0383 | +0.0349*** | 0.0108 |

*Figure: AUC point estimates with 95% CIs for FL14 binary (0.911,
[0.898, 0.925]) and continuous log(1+tenders_count) (0.939,
[0.932, 0.946]). DeLong test rejects equality at p = 2 × 10⁻⁵.
Continuous dominates; FL14 is the deployable simplification.*

## Interpretation

The continuous score dominates the binary at p < 10⁻⁴. FL14 is the
auditable deployable rule; the true signal is the continuous loss
intensity. This is the result that motivated the locked rule of
engagement: "loser-side concentration" is the concept; "frequent
losers" is the operational implementation. The paper's `FL14` cutoff is
not defended as ontologically special — it is the operational
auditable layer over the continuous primitive.

In the joint price regression, the FL14 coefficient flips negative
once the continuous score is included — the binary picks up a
truncation-induced residual that the continuous score absorbs. This
sign reversal is part of the price-scope evidence
([AN-019](an-019-rdd-cap-price.md),
[H:price-scope-sign-reversal](../hypotheses/price-scope-sign-reversal.md)).

## Follow-ups

- Same horse race on temporal-holdout sample
  ([AN-006](an-006-strict-prospective-holdout.md)).
- Alternative continuous transformations (rank, percentile).
- Modal-by-modal horse race
  ([AN-016](an-016-gate-d2.md)).
